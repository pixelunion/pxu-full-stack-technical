## Pixel Union Technical Interview

Welcome to **part one** of the Pixel Union full-stack technical interview!

The goal of these technical interviews is to get a feel for how you approach development, providing a platform to talk through common, day-to-day challenges and the technologies we use to solve them. You’re welcome to use whatever technologies and frameworks you’re comfortable with, just be sure it’s up-and-running for the interview.

Please complete the following steps before the interview. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours to complete.

 - Store product data server-side for several products. Include (at minimum) the following data for each product:
    - ID
    - Title
    - Price
    - Inventory
    - Image
- Create an API endpoint to fetch product data
- Display the product data in product cards on page load

You can find product images and product card mockups in the `assets/` directory of this repo.

Thanks for taking the time to complete this assessment! We’ll continue with parts two and three during your interview.

We’re looking forward to chatting with you!
